4. **Confirm the move** - Press `SPACE` or `ENTER` again to complete the move

**Important:** After selecting a piece with `SPACE`, you immediately use arrow keys to navigate to the destination square, then press `SPACE` again to confirm the move.

## Piece Selection States

Within the Playing State, there are sub-states for piece selection:

### 1. No Piece Selected
- Cursor can move freely with arrow keys
- `SPACE`/`ENTER` attempts to select piece at cursor position

### 2. Piece Selected

## Error States

The game handles various error conditions gracefully:
- Invalid move attempts (no error display, move is rejected)
- AI failures (error message shown, control returns to human)
- Missing API keys (game runs in local two-player mode)
- Ctrl+C handling (graceful shutdown)

## Running in tmux

To properly display the game with colors in tmux, you need to configure tmux for true color support:

### 1. Configure tmux for true color

Add these lines to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
# For tmux 3.2+
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
set -ag terminal-features ",xterm-256color:RGB"

# For older tmux versions
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
set -ga terminal-overrides ",*256col*:Tc"
```

### 2. Start tmux with proper environment

```bash
# Set terminal type before starting tmux
export TERM=xterm-256color
tmux new-session -s checkers
```

### 3. Verify true color support

Inside tmux, test if true color is working:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If you see orange text, true color is working correctly.

### 4. Terminal requirements

- Minimum terminal size: 80x24 characters
- The board requires at least 53 characters width and 18 lines height
- If the terminal is too small, the board will not render

## Notes

- The game maintains a clean, focused interface with no menus or configuration screens
- All game options are determined by environment variables at startup
- Board cells are enlarged for better visibility in terminal
- Red pieces start at top (rows 0-2), Black at bottom (rows 5-7)
- The game uses RGB colors which require true color terminal support
