## How to Move a Piece - Step by Step

**The complete flow for moving a piece:**

1. **Navigate to your piece** - Use arrow keys (`‚Üë` `‚Üì` `‚Üê` `‚Üí`) to move the cursor to the piece you want to move
2. **Select the piece** - Press `SPACE` or `ENTER` to select it (the piece will be highlighted)
3. **Navigate to destination** - Use arrow keys (`‚Üë` `‚Üì` `‚Üê` `‚Üí`) to move the cursor to where you want to move the piece
4. **Confirm the move** - Press `SPACE` or `ENTER` again to complete the move

**Important:** After selecting a piece with `SPACE`, you immediately use arrow keys to navigate to the destination square, then press `SPACE` again to confirm the move.

## Piece Selection States

Within the Playing State, there are sub-states for piece selection:

### 1. No Piece Selected
- Cursor can move freely with arrow keys
- `SPACE`/`ENTER` attempts to select piece at cursor position

### 2. Piece Selected
- Selected piece is highlighted with special border (bold double lines)
- **Possible valid moves are shown with green background highlighting**
- Use arrow keys to navigate to any valid move position
- `SPACE`/`ENTER` on same piece ‚Üí Deselect the piece
- `SPACE`/`ENTER` on valid move ‚Üí Execute the move
- `SPACE`/`ENTER` on another piece of same color ‚Üí Select new piece

### 3. Multi-capture Mode
- After capturing, if more captures are available with the same piece
- Piece remains selected automatically
- Only capture moves are shown
- Must complete all available captures

## Game Rules Enforced

- **Forced Capture**: If a capture is available, it must be taken
- **Multi-capture**: After capturing, if the same piece can capture again, it must
- **King Promotion**: Pieces reaching the opposite end become kings
- **Turn Alternation**: White always starts, players alternate turns

## Error States

The game handles various error conditions gracefully:
- Invalid move attempts (no error display, move is rejected)
- AI failures (error message shown, control returns to human)
- Missing API keys (game runs in local two-player mode)
- Ctrl+C handling (graceful shutdown)

## Running in tmux

To properly display the game with colors in tmux, use the following command to create a session with true color support:

```bash
# Create tmux session with color support enabled
TERM=xterm-256color tmux new-session -s checkers \; \
  set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color" \; \
  set -ag terminal-features ",xterm-256color:RGB"
```

This single command:
- Sets the TERM environment variable
- Creates a new tmux session named "checkers"
- Configures the session for true color support

### Verify true color support (optional)

Inside tmux, you can test if true color is working:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If you see orange text, true color is working correctly.

### Terminal requirements

- Minimum terminal size: 80x24 characters
- The board requires at least 53 characters width and 18 lines height
- If the terminal is too small, the board will not render

### Capturing colors in tmux (for automation/agents)

When automating the game or using agents, capture the pane with ANSI color codes to see highlighted moves:

```bash
# Capture with colors preserved
tmux capture-pane -t <pane-id> -p -e

# Example to see the board with highlighted moves
tmux capture-pane -t %5 -p -e | head -40
```

This is essential because:
- Selected pieces are highlighted with bold borders
- **Possible moves are highlighted with green background color** (RGB: 120,140,100)
- Without color capture, these visual cues are invisible

## Efficient Keyboard Input (for automation/agents)

When automating gameplay through tmux, you can send multiple key combinations at once for efficiency:

```bash
# Send multiple arrow keys in one command
tmux send-keys -t <pane-id> Up Up Right Right

# Navigate diagonally with combined commands
tmux send-keys -t <pane-id> Down Down Down Left Left Space

# Example: Move from A3 to C5 in one command
tmux send-keys -t <pane-id> Right Right Up Up Space
```

This is much more efficient than sending individual keystrokes:
- Combine multiple directional movements into one command
- Add the selection/confirmation key (Space) at the end
- Reduces latency and speeds up automation

## Notes

- The game maintains a clean, focused interface with no menus or configuration screens
- All game options are determined by environment variables at startup
- Board cells are enlarged for better visibility in terminal
- Red pieces start at top (rows 0-2), Black at bottom (rows 5-7)
- The game uses RGB colors which require true color terminal support
